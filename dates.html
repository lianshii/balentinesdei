          <p>I know things hasn't been so smooth with us at the moment. For some days, we’re not in the mood.
            For how many times the things around me will put me in my worst mood, my love for you is still at its greatest.
            It doesn’t and won’t lessen the moment we argue about the little things, talk about our feelings, and have
            misunderstandings. I know for the most part that I am too soft for all of it, but I’m trying my best.
          </p>
         
          <p>Even if things has been like this for us, it doesn’t tire me out. All I wanna do is get myself up,
            fix whatever it is that’s hindering the both of us. I don’t want you to feel that whenever we have things
            that put us off our mood, we’re gonna be against each other. You know I’ll be there whenever.
            For how much we’ll argue in the near future, I hope you always keep in mind that it’s us against the problem,
            not each other.
          </p>


          <p>Maybe sometimes it’s draining to think of how much you’ll have to reassure me that what you’re going through
            is not about us. I’m just afraid that you’re slipping away from me in plain sight. To all the things I do, It all
            leads back to you. No matter how busy I am, I’m always thinking of you. Whenever I’m upset, I still think about how
            you’re doing while I’m trying to cool myself down. I’d lower my pride down numerous times, just don’t let me lose
            you that way.
          </p>


          <p>
            We’re both busy this week, but I’ll make time to see you. Even if we won’t get to spend this day together,
            know that every other day with you is as special as this. You know I’ve been missing you so much already.
            And I keep looking forward to the day I’ll get to witness the way you’ll shine brighter than everybody else
            from my point of view. Saan man mapapadpad, patuloy na susundan ang patutunguhan ng iyong bawat hakbang
            mapa-gabi pa man ang iyong pagsipot. Sana payagan sunduin, thank u.
          </p>


          <p>
            I will always miss you the moment we say our goodbyes to take care of personal matters. No matter how
            long a time I have spent being with you, may it be a day or two, It still would not change the way I will
            miss you. I love you with all my heart, yungs. Hindi bababa, sasayad, magkukulang sa sobra-sobra pa.
